# clomebrew

**Clomebrew** brings [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to Clojure.

**WARNING**: This doesn’t work for now. Homebrew relies a lot on `fork` to
execute subprocesses and this is not supported on JRuby. We need to find a way
around that.

## Usage

You need to already have a working Homebrew installation.
